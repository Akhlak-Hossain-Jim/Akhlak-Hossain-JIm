Hi there âœ‹!

I'm a self-taught Frontend Developer and UX designer(Learning). I have been working in Frontend for more than two years with technologies including HTML, CSS, SASS/SCSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, Javascript, Reactjs, NextJs, styled-components, and many more. I'm passionate about discovering new things, Human interaction, psychology, highly curious, and focused on learning from all parts of life. In my personal life, I look at things and try to analyze them to solve or think, how that could be different in a better way and what I can learn from it. I've worked on different kinds of projects, small to large challenging projects to embrace my skills. No matter what I do, I am very invested. And in every moment, I'm growing.

>The world is constantly evolving and introducing lots of things than ever before. That's why only technology is not enough; It's how a piece of tech or software technology makes you feel. And It all starts by connecting with you.
