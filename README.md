## About
This is Jim Front-end Developer | IT Support Specialist | Traveler | Curious Soul. Who loves to learn new things, exploring the world by traveling. I create strenuous websites that are fast, easy to use, and build with best practices & utmost dedication. And love to work with hardware and help people with their IT devices.

I started creating and developing websites since I was 16. I work to make websites more responsive, interactive, simple, beautiful, and user-friendly, and easily readable for other developers. And work with hardware in the background to ensure everything is working properly.

Iâ€™m hungry to learn new things and from every single setback. So I look forward to learning from all people and practice it to better use.
