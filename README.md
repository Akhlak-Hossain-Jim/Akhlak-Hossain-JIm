Hi there âœ‹!

I'm a self-taught Front-end Developer and UX designer(Learning). I am working in Frontend for more than 2 years with technologies including HTML, CSS, SASS/SCSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind css, Javascript, Reactjs, NextJs, styled-components and many mor. I'm passionate about discovering new things, Human interaction, and psychology, and highly curious, and focused on learning all parts of life. In my personal life, I look at things and try to analyze them to solve or to think, how that could be different in a positive way and what I can learn from it. I've worked on different kinds of projects, small to large challenging projects to embrace my skills. No matter what I do, I am very invested. And in every moment, I'm growing.
